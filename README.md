This is a recreation of Fruit Ninja. 

All of my main code is in game.js and the Rectangle class is in classes.js. If I had more time, I would have added particles for when the user sliced a fruit/bomb, add a "stain" on the background, and add an effect that trails the cursor. I would also improve the start and end screens, and replace the counter and x's with images.
